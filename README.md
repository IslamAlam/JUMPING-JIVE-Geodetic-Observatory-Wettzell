# Task 5: Dynamic ZABBIX maps

ZABBIX supports maps to show relationships between components monitored or to show locations of components on background images. These images are quite helpful to identify issues. 
Usually, these maps are static setups showing facilities of companies and so on. Because VLBI sessions include different locations and antennas, it would be valuable to dynamically change the maps. It would be especially interesting for world maps showing the telescopes of the current session and their states. As ZABBIX monitoring sets can completely be changed using the API based on JSON-RPC 2.0, it should be possible to adapt maps or create new maps (see https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/3.2/manual/api). 

What to do? 

A ZABBIX installation should be used to dynamically adapt and change ZABBIX maps with a world map as background to add and delete telescope positions. 
Single tasks:
* Install Ubuntu Linux as Windows Wubi installation 
* Install ZABBIX on Linux 
* Understand ZABBIX 
* Understand the ZABBIX API 
* Write a program or script to create a new map and to add or delete a telescope position

JUMPING JIVE: Joining up Users for Maximizing the Profile, the Innovation and Necessary Globalization of JIVE

![](/sites/jive.nl/files/cms/projects/JJ-logo-no-text.jpg)

The [JUMPING JIVE project](http://jumping.jive.eu/) aims to take Very Long Baseline Interferometry ([VLBI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-long-baseline_interferometry#VLBI_arrays "Opens in new window: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very-long-baseline_interferometry#VLBI_arrays")) <link>into the next decade, with [JIVE](http://www.jive.eu) <link>and the European VLBI Network ([EVN](http://www.evlbi.org/intro/intro.html "Opens in new window: http://www.evlbi.org/intro/intro.html")) <link>as globally recognized centres of excellence in radio astronomy.

The project brings together scientists and engineers to define the future of VLBI for scientific applications, and identify the required technological innovation to realise such a future. The project work packages cover a number of topics, which include encouraging existing telescopes to join the EVN, connecting with future instruments ([Square Kilometre Array](http://skatelescope.org/ "Opens in new window: http://skatelescope.org/"), African VLBI Network), and finding new JIVE partners to expand the membership base. In addition, there are resources for a dedicated outreach effort.

JIVE <link>is leading the project from its base in Dwingeloo (the Netherlands). Twelve institutes <link>from eight different European countries have teamed up in JUMPING JIVE. The project was awarded nearly 3 million euros, over a period of 4 years, by the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme of the EU.
